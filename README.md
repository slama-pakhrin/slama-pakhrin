Hi, my name is Arii and I am a developing programmer. 
I am originally from Nepal but currently pursuing my studies in Toronto. I study on my own more than from my uni ;) and I love to play football which now is replaced by coding. 

### WannaBe âš¡
I am learning React currently trying to get into the front end development. However, I am starting Swift with Objective C to build mobile Apps. 
I am looking forward to get good grasp on both of the developments within the first quarter of the year 2024.
I am currently working on my portfolio and some bunch of other projects, mostly web apps for now.
